# Gad Language — IntelliJ Platform plugin

Language support for **Gad** (`.gad` / `.gadt` / `.gadx`) in JetBrains IDEs
(IntelliJ IDEA, GoLand, WebStorm, PyCharm, …). Marketplace name **Gad Language**;
plugin ID `dev.gad-lang.gad`. See <https://gad-lang.github.io>.

Design and roadmap: [`PLAN.md`](PLAN.md).

## Features

- **Syntax highlighting** for the three dialects, via a TextMate bundle assembled
  at build time from the [`gad-textmate`](https://github.com/gad-lang/gad-textmate)
  git submodule (the shared Gad bundle — single source of truth, no hand-written
  lexer).
- **Run configurations** with execution profiles: script, arguments, working
  directory, environment variables and `GADPATH`. Runs `gad <script> …`.
- **Debugger** over the Gad Debug Adapter (`gad debug --dap`):
  - line breakpoints and **conditional breakpoints**;
  - **call stack** with per-frame navigation, including **into imported files**;
  - **step** in / over / out, **resume** and **pause**;
  - **variables** inspection (Locals) and **evaluate** (Watches / Debug Console /
    on-hover);
  - console output, terminate/disconnect.
- **Settings** (Settings ▸ Tools ▸ Gad): the `gad` executable location and a
  default `GADPATH`.
- **Config schema** validation/completion for `.gad.yaml` / `.gadide.yaml`
  (schemas reused from the `gad-textmate` submodule's `schemas/`).

## Requirements

- A `gad` binary on `PATH` (or set its location in Settings ▸ Tools ▸ Gad). The
  debugger requires a `gad` built **with** the `debug` command (the default
  build; the `nodebug` build tag removes it).
- JDK 21 to build the plugin.

## Build

The IntelliJ Platform Gradle plugin downloads the target IDE SDK on first build.
The grammars come from the `gad-textmate` submodule, so check it out first
(`git submodule update --init`, or clone with `--recurse-submodules`). A
`Makefile` wraps the common Gradle tasks:

```sh
cd plugins/ide/intellij-gad
git submodule update --init   # populate gad-textmate (grammars/schemas)
make help        # list targets
make compile     # compile the Kotlin (fast sanity check)
make build       # → build/distributions/intellij-gad-<version>.zip
make test        # unit tests
make verify      # JetBrains Plugin Verifier
make check       # compile + test + verify
make run         # launch a sandbox IDE with the plugin
make clean
```

Each target just calls `./gradlew <task>` (the committed wrapper); override the
JDK with `make JAVA_HOME=/path build`. Install the built `.zip` via *Settings ▸
Plugins ▸ ⚙ ▸ Install Plugin from Disk*.

## Releases

Releases are produced automatically by the [`release`](.github/workflows/release.yml)
GitHub Actions workflow: **push a `v*` tag** and it builds the plugin and
publishes a GitHub Release with the plugin **`.zip` attached as a downloadable
asset**. The tag drives the plugin version, and a tag with a pre-release suffix
(e.g. `-rc.1`) marks the release as a pre-release.

```sh
git tag v0.1.0            # or v0.1.0-rc.1 for a pre-release
git push origin v0.1.0
```

The workflow (no local IDE needed — it downloads the IntelliJ Platform):

1. builds `build/distributions/intellij-gad-<version>.zip` with
   `./gradlew buildPlugin -PpluginVersion=<tag>`,
2. creates the release for the tag with auto-generated notes,
3. uploads the `.zip` as a release asset.

Download the `.zip` from the release and install it via *Settings ▸ Plugins ▸ ⚙ ▸
Install Plugin from Disk*. The exact build is shown in *Settings ▸ Build, Execution,
Deployment ▸ Gad ▸ About* (version, commit id + time).

You can also trigger the workflow manually (**Actions ▸ release ▸ Run workflow**)
to validate the build without publishing.

## Architecture

The plugin is a thin front-end over the Gad CLI's protocols:

| Concern | Implementation |
| --- | --- |
| Highlighting | `highlight/GadBundleProvider` ships the shared `gad-textmate` grammars as a TextMate bundle |
| File identity | `lang/GadFile` (extension check) + `lang/GadFileIconProvider` (icon) |
| Run | `run/*` — `GadRunConfiguration` + profile form + `GadCommandLineState` (`gad <script>`) |
| Debug | `debug/*` — `GadDebugProcess` bridges `debug/dap/DapClient` (DAP over stdio) to the XDebugger |
| Config | `config/GadJsonSchemaProviderFactory` maps the reused JSON schemas |
| Settings | `settings/*` — application-level `gad` path + default `GADPATH` |

The debugger relies on the adapter reporting **per-frame source paths** and
honoring **launch profiles** (`args`/`cwd`/`env`/`GADPATH`) — shipped in the Gad
CLI (`cmd/gad/dap.go`).

## Building against a local IDE

By default the build downloads IntelliJ IDEA Community. To compile and package
against a locally-installed IDE instead (e.g. your GoLand), pass its path:

```sh
make build GRADLE_FLAGS="--console=plain -PlocalIdePath=/opt/GoLand-2026.1.1"
# or: ./gradlew buildPlugin -PlocalIdePath=/opt/GoLand-2026.1.1
```

This is handy to verify the plugin against the exact IDE it will run in.

## Status

Working: verified in GoLand 2026.1 — file types, run/debug configuration,
settings and icons are live. `make build` compiles the Kotlin and packages a
valid plugin `.zip` (grammars + schemas bundled, `plugin.xml` verified). The full
debugger flow, the Plugin Verifier pass and the Marketplace listing are the
remaining ship steps (PLAN.md, phase 4). The IntelliJ SDK download is out of scope
for this repo's Go CI, so the plugin builds in its own Gradle job.
